User Story 1
As a player, I want to purify polluted monsters so that I can reduce the area’s pollution and progress further.

Acceptance Criteria

Given a polluted monster is present, when the player uses the purification ability, then the monster’s pollution level is visibly reduced.

Given all key monsters in an area are purified, when the pollution core is activated, then the area pollution index decreases.

User Story 2
As a player, I want my purification ability to evolve so that I can interact with new types of obstacles.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the player clears Area A, when the pollution core is purified, then Ability Level 2 is unlocked.

Given Ability Level 2 is unlocked, when the player encounters polluted fog or walls, then those obstacles can be cleared.
