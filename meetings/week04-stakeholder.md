User Story 1
As a player, I want to purify polluted monsters so that I can reduce the area’s pollution and progress further.

Acceptance Criteria

Given a polluted monster is present, when the player uses the purification ability, then the monster’s pollution level is visibly reduced.

Given all key monsters in an area are purified, when the pollution core is activated, then the area pollution index decreases.

User Story 2
As a player, I want my purification ability to evolve so that I can interact with new types of obstacles.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the player clears Area A, when the pollution core is purified, then Ability Level 2 is unlocked.

Given Ability Level 2 is unlocked, when the player encounters polluted fog or walls, then those obstacles can be cleared.

Environment-Based Gated Exploration

The world is divided into interconnected regions that are visible but inaccessible until the correct abilities are obtained.

User Story 3
As a player, I want to see blocked areas early so that I understand there is more to explore later.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the player is in Area A, when they view the map, then Areas B and C are visible but partially inaccessible.

Given the player lacks the required ability, when they approach polluted terrain, then access is blocked with visual feedback.

User Story 4
As a player, I want my actions to visibly change the environment so that I feel my progress matters.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the area pollution index decreases, when the environment updates, then visual changes (lighter fog, cracks, cleaner colors) appear.

Given pollution increases again (Difficulty Level 2), when time passes or the player is corrupted, then the environment visibly worsens.

Epic 3: Risk, Death, and Feedback Systems

The game provides clear feedback about danger, pollution, and player status.

User Story 5
As a player, I want clear feedback on pollution and corruption so that I can make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria

Given a monster is polluted, when the player observes it, then a visible pollution meter is shown.

Given the player is attacked or touches polluted entities, when corruption increases, then a UI indicator updates immediately.

User Story 6
As a player, I want death to be punishing but fair so that I am encouraged to retry.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the player’s corruption reaches the maximum, when they die, then they respawn at the last purification point.

Given abilities have been unlocked, when the player respawns, then unlocked abilities are retained.
