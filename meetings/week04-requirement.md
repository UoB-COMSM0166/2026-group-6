## Given Core Gameplay Experience (for player and all the designers)
To gain the idea of protect surrounding enviroment, to give a possible perspective of future about what we might face if continue to pollute. We design this game for all the potential player who are interested in playing a light web page game outside the real world but still have sone connections with the reality, at least of the basic mathmatical and physical working methods. 
After loads of burden in the reality, the potential players may want to relax themselves but don't want to way beyond to consuming more energy to devote themselves to understand and embrake one total and completely fantastical journey. Especially for the players who don't want to download the games requiring conditions of computer configuration, just want to relax and stop enjoying at anytime they want. Nowadays, peeple are all struggling to deal with the hard part of their study or work, must have a way to release the pressure and have the possiblity to stop and begain to handle various unexpected situations in real life at the same time. And also we are too exhausted, no much time to think, so we don't want to teach our player what they need to do by boring talking, but we want them to receive the thoughts to against pollution by themselves after getting what they really want--relaxing by a small game, the basic rule of designing is to make the target costumers to accept and approve it, all the other ideas are our team's special enhancements for the game.

## The systems we want to design
### Enviromental Purification System
### Progressive Area Unlocking
### Player Power Evolution System
### Numbers of Lifes System
### Progress Saving System
### Physical and Mathematical Real Model Calculation System
### Rope-based Puzzle Interaction

# 3. Write epics and users stories for your game from the stakeholders' perspective( at least 2 stories per team member), make sure to wirte down acceptance criteria as well.

## User Story 1: As a player, I want to play a game which can stop at anytime because you know sometimes I will be interupted by some suddent situations like phone calls or delivery's arrive, easy to stop and easy to back again. At least I don't want to start all over again after I stop or leave at once.
## User Story 2: As a player, I want death to be punishing but fair so that I am encouraged to retry but don't want to start all over again.
- We will design a **Progress Saving System** let players have the right to stop at anytime they want but we might prefer to access it by designing a spcial point of saving to realise, beacuse we don't want our player missing any wonderful stories and explores after stopping a long time, but we will try to put more saving points as much as possible at just one map, so we can catch the goal of easy stop and easy to back.
- Given the player’s corruption reaches the maximum, when they die, then they respawn at the last purification point. Given abilities have been unlocked, when the player respawns, then unlocked abilities are retained.

## User Story 3: As a player, I want to play a game which can bring new things all the time, don't want to feel boring. New things will appear by I don't know maybe every 5 minutes?
- we will add **Enviromental Purification System** so that everything around the player will have the possiblity to change, player will continuously receiving stimulations from new things makes they feel not boring at all.
- we will also add **Progressive Area Unlocking** to the map so the player will find new map after they doing some actions, so they feel enjoyable to continue, having the interest to unlock all the maps according to the inherent curiosity and exploration desire in human nature regarding unknown things.

## User Story 4: As a player, I want to play such a hard game which makes me feel even more pressure, some games are too easy to die and don't want to continue eventhough the design are good.
- We will add the **Enviromental Purification System**, so the player can purify polluted monsters so that I can reduce the area’s pollution and progress further.The player gradually unlocks new purification abilities that change how they interact with the world as well, so wouldn't be too difficult to play and lose patient to continue. Given all key monsters in an area are purified, when the pollution core is activated, then the area pollution index decreases.

## User Story 5: As a developer, I want to make players not so boring and losing interests to play but I should not add too much things at the begining as well.
## User Story 6: As a game designer, I want to make players not so easy to pass, and also not so easy to quit my game. Not let players to do all the same things on and on and on.
- we consider about the **Player Power Evolution System** which makes they feel they are powerful to control the current game and have the ability to influence the environment. Given a polluted monster is present, when the player uses the purification ability, then the monster’s pollution level is visibly reduced. Purification ability to evolve so they can interact with new types of obstacles. Given the player clears Area A, when the pollution core is purified, then Ability Level 2 is unlocked. Given Ability Level 2 is unlocked, when the player encounters polluted fog or walls, then those obstacles can be cleared.

## User Story 7: As a player, I want to see blocked areas early so that I understand there is more to explore later.
- Given the player is in Area A, when they view the map, then Areas B and C are visible but partially inaccessible. After the player lacks the required ability, when they approach polluted terrain, then access is blocked with visual feedback.

## User Story 8: As a player, I want my actions to visibly change the environment so that I feel my progress matters.
- Given the area pollution index decreases, when the environment updates, then visual changes (lighter fog, cracks, cleaner colors) appear will give clear feedback to player. And the decisions or percentage of locking purifried areas will leads to different ends like bad end if nothing changed(to reach the basic line to the end of the story just 60% areas are locked), good end(over 80%), perfect end(at least 95% to nearly 100%), truth end(100%).

## User Story 9: As a level designer, I don't want to show everything at the beginning which makes my design a kind of boring and no fun.
- **Environment-Based Gated Exploration**, The world is divided into interconnected regions that are visible but inaccessible until the correct abilities are obtained.

## User Story 10: As a game designer, I want UI to show different when the player being attacked by the monsters or fogs.
- UI should add filters to our **Risk, Death, and Feedback Systems**. The game provides clear feedback about danger, pollution, and player status. When the player observes one or more monsters, a visible pollution meter will shown above the monsters, evertime the player is attacked or touching any polluted entities like fogs, a UI indicator updates immediately.
