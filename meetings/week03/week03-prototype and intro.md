# 'Pollution purification' horizontal plate jumping puzzle game

An action-based, puzzle-solving, non-linear map, lightweight RPG level-breaking game


# Background

Aliens on a polluted and nearly destroyed planet have entered hibernation pods waiting to escape the planet. Players will take on the role of an advanced artificial intelligence robot that collects fuel from various places deep within the planet to return to the spaceship. The robot is equipped with two rope-like tools made of special materials (which can have different props installed on its head) and stored cleaning energy (which can purify pollution and explore the map). However, in the process of searching for fuel and incidentally purifying pollution, the planet is unknowingly getting better. Before boarding the spaceship to depart, there may eventually be different choices and endings.


## Points
The more fuel you find, the higher your score.

When the purification level reaches a certain stage: hidden endings can be triggered or the map environment can change.

# Gameplay mechanics

- The character has two rope-like tools made of special materials (referred to as ropes for short). Clicking the mouse throws the rope in the direction of the mouse.
	- Can transmit cleaning energy
	- Can expand and contract
	- Different functional props can be installed at the head of the rope
	- Can change the material of the rope to hard (straight line can support weight) or soft (can bend and cannot support weight). Soft ropes will form a parabola under the influence of the gravity of the head prop.
	- When the head of the rope touches a polluted monster or object, it can transmit cleaning energy for purification.

## Rope-related props

### Rope launching prop

- Can shoot ropes at high speed
- Ropes that can control the shooting force

### The prop at the head of the rope

- Slime: Can stick to buildings. 
- Claw: Can grab certain items or small monsters and change their positions. 
- Other special props for solving puzzles: rolling iron balls, balloons, etc.


## Purification ability (core ability) / Clean energy

- Used to purify pollutants in the map; the purification ability can be upgraded upon completion of levels.
- Can purify pollution cores and monsters present in the map through contact and ropes. Initially, it has a certain amount of cleaning energy, which can be collected and replenished in the map through a certain method.


# Map mechanism


Map Area A (Initial Exploration Zone): 
Players can fully explore this area at the start of the game. The area mainly contains low-complexity mutated monsters. The pollution status on the monsters is visible, serving as teaching and feedback for the purification mechanism. When players successfully purify the key monsters in the area and reduce the regional pollution index, they can unlock the second use of the purification ability. After this ability is unlocked, players will be able to enter or explore more deeply into previously inaccessible paths in other areas due to environmental pollution.

Map Area B (Environmentally Gated): 
This area is partially visible in the early stages of the game but cannot be fully explored. The main obstacles in the area are not monsters, but polluted environmental elements. Players can only gradually remove these obstacles and expand the passable space after obtaining the environmental purification ability. After completing the core purification goal of this area, players will obtain the third-stage purification ability, which is used to change the structure or function of certain entities.

Map Area C (Structural Reconstruction Type): 
This area is always visible on the map, but only a very small part can be entered without the previous two abilities. The key challenges in the area come from mutated entities and the terrain structure itself. Players need to use advanced purification abilities to transform specific entities into platforms or path nodes, thereby reconstructing movement routes.

Pollution levels in areas A->B->C: Light - Moderate - Severe

In Area A, there are small monsters guarding the pollution core. Players defeat the small monsters, shut down the pollution core, the environment on the large map improves a bit, and they gain the ability to access Area B. Area B still has a pollution core, but this time there are some small monsters and polluted ground. Use the previously obtained ability to shut down the pollution core in Area B and acquire Ability 3. This allows entry into Area C, and finally, after purifying Area C, players can return to the spaceship.


## Map display content

Monster pollution level; environmental pollution index within the region. Each time monsters are purified, the regional pollution index will decrease, and the environment in the region will change accordingly.

## There are many props distributed on the map

- Props that enhance oneself: increase jumping ability, increase rope length, replenish cleaning energy, life, enhance purification ability to purify things that could not be purified before
- Props related to special material ropes
- Fuel (directly related to scores)

## Contaminated area

- There are pollution cores distributed on the map: some are related to clearing the level, and others are cores of other side levels (relatively less complex). 
- Polluted creatures (referred to as monsters for short). 
- Polluted obstacles: (such as fog, pollution walls, corrosive ground)

# The threat posed to players

- The monster's attack
- Traps, terrain (falling, poison pools, etc.)
- After the player dies, they return to a fixed save point
