# Idea2

## City building and imulation business strategy games - cross the road

### A simulation construction game that helps pedestrians cross the road

You can issue crossing instructions to pedestrians, guiding them to safely cross roads with vehicle traffic but no traffic facilities to earn funds. Use these funds to install traffic facilities such as traffic lights, zebra crossings, median platforms, mechanical arms and underpasses at appropriate locations for the next stage of levels. This allows a diverse range of pedestrians and various vehicles to achieve maximum mutual efficiency in the game of right-of-way, and thus complete the progressively upgraded challenges and those in special scenarios (measured by the time taken to get a specified number of vehicles and pedestrians through).
